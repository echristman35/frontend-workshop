    <p class = "text"> The Village started as a <b> small cafe and art gallery</b> but has quickly become a force for all things local- art, <br> music and food. Everything you 
                       experience at The Village is from your community: the produce from farms <br> just down the road, the art that fills their walls comes from all over 
                       the Brazos Valley, and the live music that <br> brings in amazing regional talent.
